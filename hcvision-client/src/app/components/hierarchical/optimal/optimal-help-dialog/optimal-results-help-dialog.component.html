      <p><strong>Locate the value of the maximum Inconsistency coefficient:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Identify the linear graph marked with blue and find the point where the Inconsistency coefficient is maximized.

      <p><strong>At that value, locate the number of clusters that corresponds:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Check the corresponding position on the graph to determine the number of clusters associated with the maximum
        Inconsistency coefficient.

    <div class="step-content">
      <p><strong>Find from the bar graphs which linkage has that number of clusters:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Refer to the bar graphs and identify the linkage method that corresponds to the previously determined number of
        clusters.

      <p><strong>The combination of number of clusters and linkage are the recommended parameters:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Based on your findings, the recommended parameters for the algorithm are the identified number of clusters and
        the corresponding linkage method.

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Explanation of Inconsistency Coefficient:</em> The inconsistency coefficient measures the difference
        between a potential clustering and the average clustering over different scales. A higher coefficient indicates
        a better-defined clustering.
      </li>
      <li><em>Explanation of Linkage:</em> Linkage refers to the method used to calculate the distance between clusters.
        Common linkage methods include single, complete, and average linkage.
