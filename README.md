# HCvision - autoML Hierarchical Clustering Visualiser

HCvision is currently under development as a component of my bachelor's thesis in computer science at the [International Hellenic University.](https://www.iee.ihu.gr/)

## About

This application will allow users to upload datasets on which they wish to perform cluster analysis, help them determine both the number of clusters and the appropriate cluster proximity method, perform the clustering, and present the user with the results. 
The application will have a user-friendly web interface and a WEB API which will allow all operations to be performed via http requests. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Backend - API
The REST API being developed will include endpoints for user authentication, dataset file management, agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis, and the respective business logic.
